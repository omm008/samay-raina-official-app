# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create the RotatingTriangle component with basic 3D structure
  - Create new file `src/components/RotatingTriangle.jsx`
  - Implement the three triangle faces using div elements with CSS borders
  - Set up the basic 3D transform container with `transform-style: preserve-3d`
  - Position the three faces to form a 3D triangle using CSS transforms
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement CSS animation for x-axis rotation
  - Add CSS keyframes for continuous rotation from 0deg to 360deg on x-axis
  - Apply animation to the triangle container with 20-second duration
  - Use linear timing function for consistent rotation speed
  - Set animation to infinite iteration
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Add responsive design and styling
  - Implement responsive sizing using CSS media queries or props
  - Set appropriate colors that complement the existing gradient background
  - Add semi-transparent styling to blend with the hero section
  - Ensure triangle maintains proportions across different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Integrate RotatingTriangle into HeroSection component
  - Import RotatingTriangle component in HeroSection.jsx
  - Position the triangle absolutely within the hero section container
  - Set appropriate z-index to place triangle behind main content
  - Ensure triangle doesn't interfere with existing layout and spacing
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Add browser compatibility and performance optimizations
  - Implement feature detection for CSS 3D transform support
  - Add graceful degradation for browsers without 3D support
  - Apply hardware acceleration using transform3d and will-change properties
  - Add support for prefers-reduced-motion accessibility setting
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Write unit tests for RotatingTriangle component
  - Create test file for RotatingTriangle component
  - Test component renders without errors
  - Test that CSS classes and styles are applied correctly
  - Test responsive behavior with different prop values
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 7. Write integration tests for HeroSection with triangle
  - Test that RotatingTriangle appears in the hero section
  - Verify z-index layering doesn't obstruct other content
  - Test that existing hero section functionality remains intact
  - Verify animation runs smoothly without performance issues
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 1.3_

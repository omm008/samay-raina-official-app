# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a 3D rotating triangle element to the HeroSection component of the Samay Raina app. The triangle will serve as a visual enhancement, rotating slowly on its x-axis to create an engaging animated background element that complements the existing hero content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the website, I want to see a visually appealing 3D rotating triangle animation in the hero section, so that the page feels more dynamic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the system SHALL display a 3D triangle element
2. WHEN the triangle is displayed THEN the system SHALL continuously rotate it slowly on the x-axis
3. WHEN the triangle rotates THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth animation without performance issues
4. WHEN the triangle is rendered THEN the system SHALL position it as a background element that doesn't interfere with existing content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor using different devices, I want the 3D triangle to display properly across various screen sizes, so that the visual experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is viewed on desktop THEN the system SHALL display the triangle at an appropriate size
2. WHEN the page is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL scale the triangle appropriately
3. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the triangle's visual proportions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor with different browser capabilities, I want the 3D triangle to work across modern browsers, so that I can experience the animation regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads in modern browsers THEN the system SHALL render the 3D triangle using CSS transforms
2. WHEN 3D transforms are not supported THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade or hide the element
3. WHEN the animation runs THEN the system SHALL use hardware acceleration when available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the 3D triangle to integrate seamlessly with the existing hero section design, so that it enhances rather than distracts from the main content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the triangle is displayed THEN the system SHALL position it behind the main hero content
2. WHEN the triangle animates THEN the system SHALL ensure it doesn't obstruct text readability
3. WHEN the triangle is rendered THEN the system SHALL use colors that complement the existing gradient background
4. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing layout and spacing of other elements
